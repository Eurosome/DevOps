**If you're doing it more than once, Automate.**

Any task that is worth doing more than once is worth automating. That means you should keep your scripting skills up to date on any platform you have to work on. This will also reduce the chance for mistakes the next time you accomplish this task.

**Documentation is a Process.**

Document everything. Don't wait until after the project is done to start documenting, do it during. It will be easier for you and more accurate if you don't have to remember things you've done a long time ago. Making documentation a daily part of your routine will lessen the chance you might forget.

**Generalize as much as possible.**

Follow the Unix KISS philosophy. Your scripts should be kept simple and do one task well. They should be made generic enough to be reusable as often as possible. Similarly, your documentation should assume a minimum of previous knowledge. Think of someone who is new to the job and needs to be shown how to do something from the ground up.

**Stay Organized.**

You don't need to read a book about thought management to become more organized. Decide now on how where your scripts will be stored and ensure you always follow the same procedure. Documentation can take many forms, but often the simplest and oldest is best, such as a web portal running a wiki. You don't want to chase down your documentation across sticky notes, emails, text files and so on. Whether you use OneNote, Evernote, or any other solution, you should never have to Google for a solution twice.

**Patch and Monitor.**

Patching is something that should be a part of your automation. Whether it's desktop systems, servers or software applications, every part of the infrastructure should be automated, and you should have a way to verify that this is happening. If you can't tell at a glance how well the environment you're responsible for is doing, improve your process.

**Handle Security in Layers.**

Security doesn't end at the firewall. Don't leave privileged account passwords in text files. Implementing a password vault is quick and will make a big impact, both in making sure credentials are kept secure, but also serve as part of your documentation. Segment your networks so privileged systems don't co-exist with regular ones. Find the weak points, sandbox your web apps so they don't put the host server at risk. Monitor your firewall rules and IDS/IPS to make sure no unwanted traffic goes through. Make sure your anti-virus software is up to date and educate your users on how to behave in a secure way.

**Be Prepared for the Worst.**

Stay optimistic, but	plan	for the worst. This	means doing	proper backups	using the	3-2-1 system, having	three	copies	of	any important
data	in two formats,	making	sure you	always keep one	copy	off-site. Test	your	restore process, document	that process	and	have	a recovery
plan	that makes sense for	your environment. Think	up	scenarios	from	software bugs to online attacks,	physical	breaches,	power	failures,
flooding and fire, and find	the best	solution	for	them. People	make	mistakes,	your	procedures should	keep those mistakes	isolated.

**Keep Learning.**

Don't get set in your ways. Always strive to learn more, and keep a percentage of each year to learn new software, products, or get new certifications. Be ready to handle the next shiny thing or switch role at a moment's notice as your business evolves. Take advantage of the incredible amount of free resources from YouTube videos to the Microsoft Virtual Academy, recorded talks at USENIX, DefCon and more.

**Don't Change for Change's Sake.**

Don't fall into the trap of wanting to change something just for change's sake. Hype is not a business case. That Perl app may be old, but if it fulfills its task, leave it be. Account for the inevitable delays, cost overruns and scope changes before undertaking any new project. Avoid feature creep and ask yourself if there's a simpler way to accomplish a goal before implementing an overly complex system.

**Have Fun.**

Don't get burned out. Be respectful to your users and colleagues, but learn to say no. Think about what is most important to you, and how you will think back on these days in 10 years.
